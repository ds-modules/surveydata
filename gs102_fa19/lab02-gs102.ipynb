    "Now that you have collected some of your own survey data we are going to apply the analysis we learned in the data science modules earlier this semester to our own survey data! You will create bar charts using the demographic variables from our survey so that you can compare our sample with the larger UC Berkeley undergraduate population to determine the representativeness of our sample. You will create pivot tables with sets of variables and then create bar charts to visualize that data. You will then do some hypothesis testing. You will calculate p-values and determine whether there are any statistically significant associations. And, finally you will create word clouds for the open-ended survey questions.\n",

For instance, there is a 95.8% correlation between the per capita consumption of mozzarella cheese and the number of Civil Engineering doctorates awarded in the US. Clearly, these are two completely unrelated events that aren't linked to one another. As such, we wouldn't use this correlation as evidence of causality between these variables. \n",

    "The goal of a survey is to provide information about a large population from a limited sample. In this notebook, we've gone quite in depth in how to analyze different variables present in a survey. However, we've operated under the assumption that our survey data was representative of the UC Berkeley student population. However, in the real world, data collection is messy and difficult. Thus, we must be aware of sources of bias that may be present in our data. Here are a few common sources of bias in survey data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Undercoverage bias**: Certain groups of the population are left out of the sample, leading to an *undercoverage* of responses in the sample\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nonresponse bias**: If the survey is optional, then certain respondents may not complete it. This may lead to skewed data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Self-selection bias**: If sample members volunteer themselves to take the survey, it may be the case that they are passionate about the issues asked about. This usually leads to an over-representation of individuals with strong opinions in the survey.\n",

    "\n",
    "**TASK:** Given these sources of bias, do you see any problems with the methodology of our survey (including survey design, question wording, and distribution)? If you see any problems, what changes to our survey project would you make to fix them?\n"
