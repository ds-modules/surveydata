Trump has made, at least within my household, certain topics political that never were before. My parents are extremely fiscally conservative, but socially liberal (I know that isn't really possible, but I'm trying to give my parents the benefit of the doubt). Before Trump, we could talk about racism, homophobia, women's rights, etc without an argument because those things were not political. They connected to our morals and values they had instilled in me and we agreed on those issues; however, because of Trump, these topics have been politicized and conflated with party loyalty. Now when I bring up racism in relation to Trump's rhetoric, I am labeled a ""radical"" in my household and ""brainwashed"" by Cal. Before these were moral issues, not they are party issues, which has put a huge strain on my relationship with my parents. My parents did not vote for Obama because of his economic plans, but they supported the unity he brought to the U.S. and hope having a Black president brought to different communities. Now, they think Trump is crazy, but he has rubbed off on them. They believe in the Fake News rhetoric and the sensitivity of ""snowflake"" democrats. So... Fuck Trump and fuck what he did to my parents. Oh also, fuck Trump for being a fake Christian. He used religious rhetoric to get voters but is not religious himself. Half my family votes for him cause he's religious and one day when my aunts yell at me for ""using the Lord's name in vain"" I'm gonna backhandedly slap them and say ""Your evil satanic President using the Lord's name in vain to get your white female vote"" ",No because:,,,"While the economy is doing better and unemployment is down, the money saved by large companies has not trickled down to employees so no I don't support the Tax reform. I would describe basically all policies and reforms as fake as fuck. Trump and the Republican party have chosen a huge population of the U.S, the working class, as their voting pawns while they literally stab them in the back with their reforms. Don't even get me started on climate change stuff and his support for the coal industry. I wish we could press charges against Trump for killing Mother Nature.

I also attended the Women's March two years ago, but have skipped it the last two because it caters so much to white women and ignores those marginalized farrrrrrr beyond us. That's not to say those that go to that are bad at all. I still support it! I just try to support it in other ways than attending. ",,Definitely yes,Yes,"Hope your thesis research and writing is going well! Writing a thesis is stressful stuff on top of everything else you're probably doing at Cal, so props to you for taking this on. I hope I can read it when you're done.
